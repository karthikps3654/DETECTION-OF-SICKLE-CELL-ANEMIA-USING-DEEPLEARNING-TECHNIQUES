# Detection of Anemia Using Deep Learning Techniques

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection of anemia using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify and detect red and white blood cells (RBCs and WBCs) from medical images. The project involves data preprocessing, image manipulation, model training, and evaluation using various techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Extracts and processes image annotations, normalizes bounding box coordinates, and prepares data for training and validation.
- **Image Visualization**: Displays images with bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Model Training**: Builds and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images.
- **Evaluation**: Generates and visualizes performance metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- shutil
